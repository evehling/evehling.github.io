# Hello there!

Hi! I'm Elisabeth, an undergrad senior/progressive master student @ USC studying cognitive science, informatics, and computer science! I discovered my love for coding in my sophomore year and have been addicted ever since. I love learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies! Here are some of my current skills, projects, and other useful links about me. Thx for visiting!
